# A private package

This is a really simple example of a private package. This is useful for packages designed only for internal use, that should not be published to NPM.

Note that it is almost the same as the simple package, it simply has `private: true` in the `package.json`

You can use how it is set up to model your own packages, but can likely delete it.
