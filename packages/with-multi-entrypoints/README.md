# A package with multiple entrypoints

This package is designed to show off multiple entrypoints. We strongly recommend you check out [preconstruct's multiple entry point guide](https://preconstruct.tools/tutorials/multiple-entrypoints) if you plan to use multiple entrypoints - as it provides a lot of context on when this is appropriate, and how to do it.

Multiple entrypoints can be hard, and include nuance.

You can use how it is set up to model your own packages, but can likely delete it.
